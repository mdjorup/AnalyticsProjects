# AnalyticsProjects
This is a repository of all my (Michael Djorup) analytics projects. I grouped all of my jupyter notebooks by category. So far, I have focussed on basketball analytics. Below are brief descriptions of each of the notebooks and some findings.


## Phishing_Classification
The objective of this notebook was to classify urls as phishing or non-phishing. Given the url and some metadata about its lifetime, I extracted different features of the URL that I thought could help the models determine phishing. Achieved a testing f1-score of ~.92

## ShotClockAnalysis1
Brief analysis of how the NBA shot clock impacts make probabilities. Make probabilities steeply drop as the shot clock gets closer to 0. Make probabilities are relatively constant in the middle seconds of the shot clock. Make probabilties are highest between 20-22 seconds on the shot clock, indicating that the easiest shots to make are off of rebounds and/or fast breaks.
